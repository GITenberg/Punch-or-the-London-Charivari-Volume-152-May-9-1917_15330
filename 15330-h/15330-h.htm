    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>According to a Rome paper, HINDENBURG has requested that all
    the Royal Princes shall be removed from the West Front. The
    original plan of protecting Their Royal Highnesses by moving
    the Front further West has been definitely abandoned.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> informs us that the late
    BISSING was a "veritable angel of mercy." The KAISER is
    wondering who started this scandal.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"We are back in the days," says Mr. PRETYMAN, "when the
    Mercantile Marine and the Navy were one." If these are the
    official figures that the Press has been clamouring for, the
    bread tickets will come none too soon.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Highland sheep-raisers are said to be feeding their lambs by
    hand on a mixture of hot milk and whisky. The little patients
    appear to take kindly to the diet, and one or two have even
    been understood to suggest that it seems rather a waste of
    milk.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Imperial Government, we are informed, repudiates
    responsibility for the attack by one of its airmen on the Dutch
    village of Zierikzee, on the ground that, notwithstanding
    repeated warnings to abandon the unneutral practice, the
    village persisted in looking like a portion of the Isle of
    Wight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Saluting is said to have been abolished in the Russian Army.
    Our own military authorities, on the other hand, declare that
    it would be unwise to abolish a practice in which the inventive
    genius of the young soldier has so much scope.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Many Germans, says Mr. GERARD, have food concealed in their
    wainscoting. But very few of them have any noticeable quantity
    behind their dadoes.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>To mark the disapproval of a tax on complimentary theatre
    tickets several lifelong supporters of the British drama have
    already requested leading managers to take their names off the
    free list.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We learn from the Press, among the things that matter, that
    for two years a well-known Wye Valley angler has been trying to
    catch a certain large trout and at last he has succeeded in
    securing it. We understand that the trout died with a smile on
    his face.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We hope it is not due to the distraction of war, but America
    seems to be losing her dash. At a baseball match in New York
    the other day only three of the spectators were injured.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At the Shoreditch Tribunal a firm appealing for a man stated
    that he was "a director, traveller, buyer, manager, acted as
    cashier and costs clerk, loaded the vans, kept the place clean
    and made himself generally useful." It is just as well that
    they added the last item, or people might have thought he was
    one of those slackers we hear to much about.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>News comes from Athens that KING CONSTANTINE is realising
    his position and contemplates abdication in favour of the CROWN
    PRINCE GEORGE. It is not yet known in whose favour the CROWN
    PRINCE GEORGE will abdicate.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Phenomenal prices were again paid at CHRISTIE'S last week
    for pearls. It is thought that official action will have to be
    taken to combat the belief, widely held in munition-making
    circles, that pearls dissolved in champagne are beneficial to
    the complexion.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"When we go to the Front we become the worst criminals,"
    writes a German soldier taken prisoner at Trescault. We
    appreciate this generous attempt to shield his superiors, but
    cling to our belief that the worst criminals are still a good
    way behind the German lines.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>M. TRIEU, the Public Executioner to the Emperor of AUSTRIA,
    has just been married. The bride has promised to obey him.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is thought probable that Mexico will very shortly decide
    to declare peace on America.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Colonel W.F.N. NOEL, of Newent, claims that Gloucestershire
    cheese is as good as any made in England. He omits, however, to
    state whether these cheeses make good pets and are fond of
    children.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Paper-covered books are foreshadowed by the Publishers'
    Association, and it is rumoured that in order to conserve the
    paper supply Mr. CHARLES GARVICE has decided that in future he
    will not write more than two novels per week.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We resent the suggestion that the public is not prepared to
    accept "substitutes." Only the other day a man rushed into a
    London <i>caf&eacute;</i>, asked if they had any prussic acid,
    and, when told that they never kept it, remarked, "Very well.
    Bring me a pork pie."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Three hundred fishing-rods have been sent to the Mesopotamia
    Field Force. No request was forwarded for flies.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Dealing with IBSEN'S <i>Ghosts</i> at the Kingsway Theatre,
    the critic of a halfpenny morning paper refers to it as a
    "medley of weird psychopathy and symbolism." Just as if he were
    writing for a penny paper.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A woman at West London Police Court has been sentenced for
    "masquerading as a man." Several conscientious objectors are
    now getting very nervous on sighting a policeman.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Only egg-laying hens will be permitted to survive under the
    new regulations of the Board of Agriculture. Villagers who in
    the past have made a nice thing out of training hens to get run
    over by motor cars will be hard hit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Now that racing has been prohibited it is unlikely that the
    Slate Club Secretaries' Sprinting Handicaps will be held this
    year.</p>

    <h2>DIPLOMATIC NOTES.</h2>

    <p>The Latin-American situation remains obscure. According to
    advices from Archangel, Paraguay intends to act, though
    curiously enough a strange cloud of silence hangs over recent
    (and coming) events in Ecuador. Bolivia has decided to
    construct a fleet, despite the fact that the absence of a
    seaboard is being made a reason for sinister opposition in
    pro-German circles. Patagonia has mobilised both her soldiers,
    but her gun is still under repair.</p>

    <p>Panagua has declared war on Germany. It is hard to
    over-estimate the value of this new adhesion to the Allied
    cause. The standing army is well over six hundred strong, and
    there is a small but modern fleet, consisting of two revenue
    cutters, one super skiff, eight canoes (mounted with two pairs
    of six-inch oars) and one raft (Benamuckee class). The
    President, in a moving address to the Panaguan Senate,
    declared, "The world is watching Panagua; it does not watch in
    vain." Se&ntilde;ora Hysterica, the first woman senator, cast
    the only vote against war. "I cannot," she sobbed.</p>

    <p>Things are moving in Mexico. General CARRANZA has summoned a
    mass-meeting of ex-Presidents to consider the situation, and a
    counter-demonstration by the Brigands' Trade Union Congress is
    feared. Even as far north as Greenland the repercussion may be
    felt. Here, owing to the new r&eacute;gime of blubber-cards,
    Eskimo opinion is in a very nervous state. Indeed, according to
    an inspired semi-official utterance by Prince Bowo, the Siamese
    Deputy Vice-Consul at Fez, it is not too much to say that
    almost anything may, or may not, happen in this Arctic
    quarter.</p>

    <p>The outlook in Palestine is dark. Strict-silence is enforced
    in all public places, and even whispering is forbidden at
    street corners. More than two-thirds of the population are
    spies. Relatives are only allowed to speak to each other if
    granted a special licence or talking-ticket by the
    Sheikh-ul-Islam, though there is a special dispensation for
    mothers-in-law. The reported mobilization of eighty goats on
    Mount Tabor shows pretty clearly which way the wind is blowing;
    whilst it is persistently rumoured in Joppa that five camels
    were seen passing through Jerusalem yesterday. Suspicious
    dredging operations in the Dead Sea are also reported by a
    Berne correspondent. The future is big with presage.</p>

    <p>All eyes are fixed on the two great African Powers which
    still stand aside from the maelstr&ouml;m of war. The position
    in Ethiopia is, to say the least of it, tendentious, and at any
    moment the natives may change their skin. The coronation of the
    new Empress of Abyssinia is being followed as usual by the
    great Feast of the Blue Umbrella, at which an important
    pronouncement is, I learn, to be made. I hear, moreover (from a
    private source in Trondhjem, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Mecca and
    Amsterdam), that Wady-ul-Dzjinn, the new Premier, and a staunch
    pro-Ally, is expected to speak with no uncertain voice.
    Unfortunately serious liquorice riots have broken out in the
    capital, and these are being cunningly used by German agents to
    turn popular discontent against the Allies. Fr&auml;ulein von
    Schlimm, a niece by marriage of the acting Montenegrin Envoy,
    is accused of purposely hoarding five hundred sticks of
    "Spanish" so as to aggravate the crisis. The usually reliable
    correspondent of <i>The Salt Lake City Morning Pioneer</i>
    telegraphs (<i>vi&acirc;</i> Tomsk) that she only escaped
    lynching by distributing her treasure to the mob.</p>

    <p>In a similar way economic issues are determining the
    attitude of Thibet. Prices in Lhassa are rising fabulously. The
    new Food Controller is endeavouring to grapple with the
    situation, and the yak ration has again been reduced. It
    behoves British diplomacy to see that the ensuing discontent is
    not turned into Germanophil currents. Where is our Foreign
    Office? What is being done? We are in the third year of the War
    and yet, while the German Minister is distributing free
    arrowroot to the populace, Whitehall slumbers on. It may be
    nothing to our mandarins that a full platoon was added to the
    Thibetan field-strength only last week, and that the Government
    dinghy is already watertight.</p>

    <p><i>Later</i>. Paraguay's attitude is now defined as one of
    Stark Neutrality. Patagonia has increased her army by fifty per
    cent. The new recruit promises to make an excellent fighting
    unit.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>IN A GOOD CAUSE.</h3>

    <p>Mr. Punch begs to call attention to a Great Lottery of
    Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, etc., by many of the chief
    British artists of the day and of earlier schools, which is
    being organised, by licence of the Board of Trade, in aid of
    the St. Dunstan's Hostels for Blinded Soldiers and Sailors.
    These works of art (including many by Mr. Punch's artists) will
    be exhibited at the Bazaar which is being held this week at the
    Royal Albert Hall in aid of the same splendid cause. After May
    10th they may be seen at the Chenil Galleries. Tickets for the
    Lottery (5<i>s.</i>) are to be obtained from Mr. Kineton
    Parkes, The Chenil Galleries, 183A, King's Road, Chelsea, S.W.
    The drawing of the Lottery Prizes will take place on July 10th
    at St. Dunstan's Hostel, Regent's Park.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Mr. Punch also commends to his kind readers the claims of
    "Lamp Day," which is to be celebrated in London on Friday, May
    11th, and in the suburbs on May 12th, the birthday of FLORENCE
    NIGHTINGALE. The proceeds are to be divided between the Women's
    Service Bureau, which registers and trains women for national
    employment, and the Scottish Women's Hospitals, whose London
    units are doing gallant work with the Serbian division of the
    Russian Army in Roumania. Each of these is a cause that would
    have appealed to the heart of the "Lady of the Lamp," devoted
    pioneer of Women's Service both at home and in the field. Those
    who live outside the Metropolitan area are begged to send a
    little money to the Hon. Treasurer of Lamp Day, Lady COWDRAY,
    16, Carlton House Terrace, S.W. Cheques and Postal Orders to be
    crossed "London County and Westminster Bank, Victoria
    Branch."</p>

    <h3>DOCKING THE DRAMA.</h3>

    <p>It has been reported that, in view of the necessity for
    restricting the consumption of artificial illuminant, the
    authorities propose drastically to curtail the duration of
    theatrical entertainments. Should this prove to be the case, we
    venture to anticipate certain further regulations that may
    shortly be added to those already printed upon the
    programmes:&mdash;</p>

    <p>(1) Every possible effort must be made to reduce the
    two-and-a-half hours' traffic of the stage to one
    hour-and-a-half. With this purpose it is enacted
    that&mdash;</p>

    <p>(2) No reference to any supposed events prior to the
    commencement of the action will be permitted in the dialogue.
    All such particulars as may be essential to an understanding of
    the plot must be legibly printed upon the programmes.</p>

    <p>(3) No performer to take more than thirty-five seconds in
    quitting the stage. Backward looks and doorway pauses forbidden
    (provided always that nothing in this section shall apply to
    the case of an actor-manager when surrendering heroine to
    youthful rival).</p>

    <p>(4) All applause, except at the fall of the curtain, to be
    instantly suppressed by ushers appointed for that purpose.</p>

    <p>(5) Friend-of-the-Family parts to be restricted to one
    illustrative anecdote and one advisory monologue, neither to
    exceed three-and-a-half minutes in delivery.</p>

    <p>In addition, the Limelight Control Committee furnishes us
    with the following scale of allowances and restrictions under a
    new clause of the Defence of the Realm Act:&mdash;</p>

    <p>DRAMA.&mdash;The duration of the employment of limelight in
    Drama may be as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>During eviction of heroine into snowstorm, allowance of one
    beam for a reasonable period not to exceed one minute.</p>

    <p>For death of infant-phenomenon, double-beam lasting two
    minutes; supplementary allowance for angelic vision subsequent
    to same.</p>

    <p>Embrace of hero and heroine at curtain fall, double-beam,
    two-and-a-half minutes.</p>

    <p>FARCE AND COMEDY.&mdash;It is regretted that, in view of the
    situation, no allowances of limelight can at present be
    sanctioned.</p>

    <p>MUSICAL PLAYS AND REVUES.&mdash;Patriotic or Hortatory Songs
    may be accompanied by four beams, with supplementary allowance
    for encore verses. (N.B. In these cases application should be
    supported by a recommendation from the particular Government
    Department, War Office. Admiralty, or Ministry of Munitions,
    extolled in the proposed ballad.)</p>

    <p>Ethiopian Serenades, hitherto given by the light of
    (apparently) two full-moons, must be restricted to one beam, of
    reduced candle-power, thus combining realism with economy.</p>
    <hr />

    <h4>The Mysteries of Arboriculture.</h4>

    <p>From an American Nursery Company's pamphlet:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="note">"Practise thinning in the winter time and
        head back in the summer. A tree can be kept bearing
        practically regular crops. Of course, it is impossible to
        keep any tree bearing practically regular crops, but, of
        course, it is impossible to keep any tree bearing a full
        crop regularly. Wonders can be done by this system of
        pruning."</p>

    <h2>HINTS TO GROSVENOR HOUSE.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Punch is not more free from correspondents who know how
    to solve the food problem than other papers are.</p>

    <p>The following six letters have been selected with care from
    some thousand and three received during the week. The others
    are at the service of any enterprising editor, or Lord
    DEVONPORT can have them if he will send a waggon to take them
    away. They should make pleasant week-end reading.</p>

    <p class="ctr">AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;What we plain men want to know and what we are
    entitled to know is&mdash;What does Lord DEVONPORT eat? What
    does Mr. KENNEDY-JONES eat? What does Mr. ALFRED BUTT eat? It
    would make a vast difference to the success of the food
    campaign if each of these administrators was visible at his
    meals, doing himself extremely ill. I suggest that a prominent
    shop window should be taken for each, and they should have
    their luncheon and dinner there in full view of the public.</p>

    COMMON SENSE.</p>

    <p class="ctr">THE POWER OF BRITISH HUMOUR.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;If the Food Economy posters were more carefully
    thought out the trick would be done. I suggest, for example,
    something really pithy and witty, such as&mdash;</p>

    <table summary="Eat-less Days"

    <p class="author">Yours, etc.,<br />
    DOWNRIGHT.</p>

    <p class="ctr">TO MASTER THE ROLLS.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;My experience is that all rolls are too big. I
    personally can get through a meal comfortably with only half
    the fat roll that is automatically put before me at most of the
    restaurants. Let Lord DEVONPORT decree a roll just half the
    size, and the difference both in consumption and waste will be
    enormous. At a dinner-party which I attended the other evening,
    not, Sir, a hundred miles from your own office, the excessive
    size of the rolls was the subject of much comment. No one
    should be given the opportunity of leaving any bread. It should
    be doled out in the smallest doses.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, etc.,<br />
    OBSERVER.</p>

    <p class="ctr">THE USE OF ABUSE.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The real trouble with the food economy campaign
    is that ordinary people, who perhaps, not unnaturally, have got
    into the habit of not believing the daily papers, do not
    realise what their enemy and the chief enemy of the country at
    this moment is&mdash;I mean the German submarine. In order to
    get this fact into their intelligence I suggest that free
    classes in objurgation are at once instituted, in which,
    instead of the common "You beast!" "You brute!" "You blighter!"
    and so forth, the necessity of saying nothing but "You (U)
    boat!" in every dispute or quarrel is insisted upon. The young
    might also be thus instructed.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, etc.,<br />
    FAR SIGHTED.</p>

    <p class="ctr">WRIT SARCASTIC.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I have an infallible plan for diminishing the
    consumption of good food, at any rate among Members of the
    Government. Let them give up all other forms of nutriment and
    eat their own words. The PRIME MINISTER might begin. I am,</p>

     ORGANISED OPPOSITION.</p>

    <p class="ctr">"FOOD HOGS" SUPERSEDED.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I am told that there are people so lost to shame
    that they are still, in spite of the KING'S Proclamation and
    all the other appeals to their patriotism, eating as usual. I
    suggest that they be branded as the "Alimentary Canaille."</p>

    <p>Raw sugar, Captain BATHURST states, cannot be sold on
    account of the presence of the sugar louse. It is thought that
    Mr. POCOCK, who has so successfully brought the Zoo's rations
    into conformity with war conditions, might probably persuade
    the animal to live on hemp seed.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Changes in the Zoo's dietary," says Mr. POCOCK, "were
    effected without difficulty." The rumour that the hippopotamus
    demanded a pailful of jam with its mangel-wurzels, in the
    belief that they were some kind of homoeopathic pill, appears
    to have been baseless.</p>

    bill from a London hotel of the previous week's date. It would
    surprise you very much if I told you at which hotel "Mr.
    Perkins" stayed and what guests he entertained there.</p>

    <p>Why did the Liberian envoy call at the Foreign Office six
    times last week? His explanation, offered to an inquiring
    Pressman, that he had lost an umbrella, was naive, to say the
    least. I must not betray what I know, but I may hint that KING
    FERDINAND of Bulgaria is famous for the devious ways in which
    he carries on negotiations.</p>

    <p>A neutral diplomatist of considerable importance has never
    taken a holiday since the War began, and has always told his
    friends that he will never leave his post till peace comes. On
    an afternoon this week he was seen with beaming face buying a
    travelling rug and two portable trunks at one of London's
    largest emporia. I wonder&mdash;yes, I wonder.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, April 30th.</i>&mdash;After this week Newmarket
    will be "a blasted heath," for all horse-racing is to be
    stopped. Irish Members could hardly believe the dreadful news.
    What are the hundred thousand young men who refuse to for their
    country to do with their spare time?</p>

    <p>Scotch Members, on the contrary, were rather pleased. Mr.
    DUNCAN MILLAR, whose desire to deprive his countrymen of their
    national beverage is only equalled by his zeal on behalf of
    their national food, rejoiced in the prospect that fewer oats
    for high-mettled racers would mean more "parritch" for humble
    constituents.</p>

    <p>There never was a dockyard Member who more faithfully
    fulfilled the House of Commons' conception of the type than Sir
    CLEMENT KINLOCH-COOKE. In a comparatively short Parliamentary
    career he must have already cost the country a pretty penny in
    extra pay and pensions to the "mateys" and "matlows" of
    Devonport. Latterly he has given the Admiralty a rest and has
    devoted himself to strafing the Home Office for its alleged
    tenderness to the Conscientious Objectors lodged at
    Princetown&mdash;a race of sturdy beggars, according to his
    account, who live like fighting-cocks, do next to no work, get
    leave periodically to air their eloquence at pacifist meetings,
    and, worst of all, invade his constituency in their leisure
    hours. Mr. SHIRLEY BENN, who represents the neighbouring
    borough of Plymouth, supported this indictment, and added the
    amazing detail that one of the Princetown pacifists was an
    ex-pugilist.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"

    </div>

    <p>Invited to select from the 670 members of the House the two
    men least likely to engage in personal violence I should have
    thought myself safe in choosing Sir GEORGE GREENWOOD and Mr.
    JOSEPH KING. The former is so devoted to animals that he would
    not turn upon a worm; the thought of bloodshed so shocks the
    latter that he welcomes any suggestion of peace however
    illusory. But, when Mr. KING described a proposal of Sir
    GEORGE'S as "infected with Prussianism," that gallant knight
    promptly invited him to repeat his language outside the House;
    and Mr. KING, nothing daunted, declared his readiness "to meet
    the hon. Member where he likes and with whatever weapons he
    likes." If the meeting had come off it is believed that Blue
    Books at forty yards would have been the choice; but, happily,
    peace was soon afterwards restored.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 1st.</i>&mdash;Some of our super-patriots
    have no luck. Mr. JOYNSON-HICKS, having discovered that the
    British Vice-Consul at Riga was a gentleman with the suspicious
    name of WISKEMANN, thought that he had got hold of a sure
    thing&mdash;not the whole Hidden Hand, perhaps, but certainly
    one of the phalanges. And then down came Lord ROBERT CECIL with
    the information that the gentleman in question was not only
    British-born but was a product of Wellington and Cambridge, and
    a public servant in whom the Foreign Office had the utmost
    confidence. "Foiled again," muttered HICKS to JOYNSON, "but a
    time will come!"</p>

    <p>Like the retired soap-boiler who always looked in on
    melting-days Lord HARCOURT could not resist the attraction of
    the Office of Works' Vote. He never displayed his ability more
    signally than in the rapidity and ease with which he used as
    First Commissioner to get his Estimates through the House. It
    was a treat to hear him poking fun at the bores, demolishing
    the captious and humouring the serious critics of his
    administration. His present successor goes about his business
    in a more stolid way. In his hands the rapier has become a
    ploughshare. At first the few Members who stayed to listen
    found him <i>Le Mond qui nous ennuie</i>, but he woke them up
    later with the startling announcement that he can, if he likes,
    with a stroke of the pen remove the ladies' grille, and admit
    the fair visitors to a full view of the House, and, what is
    more important, admit the House to a full view of the fair
    visitors. For the moment, I gather, he means to hold his hand,
    pending full consideration of all the changes that such a
    revolution may involve. Besides, the SPEAKER may have to be
    consulted, although up to the present he has exhibited no
    desire to rush in where angels&mdash;bless them!&mdash;love to
    tread.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday, May 2nd.</i>&mdash;Curiosity to hear Mr. BONAR
    LAW'S first Budget-speech caused a full House. The Peers
    attended in force, and among the distinguished strangers was
    "Dr. JIM," a man of action who, as a rule, takes little
    interest in the men of talk.</p>

    <p>The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER'S Budget statement was
    praised by his predecessor for its ability and lucidity.
    Personally, I thought rapidity was its most notable
    characteristic. Unhampered by manuscript (save a couple of
    sheets of notepaper containing a few of the principal figures)
    and relying upon his exceptional memory, he rattled through his
    thousand-million totals at such a pace that my panting pencil
    toiled after him in vain. In seventy-five minutes by the clock
    he spoke four solid columns of The Times.</p>

    <p>As we have failed to drink ourselves out of our
    difficulties, for the Excise returns show a steady falling off,
    we <span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"
       id="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span> are to do our bit towards
       smoking ourselves out of them by paying 1<i>s.</i>
       10<i>d.</i> a pound more on our tobacco. This last impost
       constitutes a real piece of self-denial on the CHANCELLOR'S
       part, for he is much addicted to cigars both long and
       strong, somewhat resembling those which enabled Mr. W.J.
       TRAVIS to carry off the Amateur Golf Championship to
       America.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, May 3rd.</i>&mdash;The secrets of the Budget
    were so well kept that Mr. LAW himself forgot the most
    important of them until to-day. In future it will be a case of
    "one man (or woman) one dog," unless the owner is prepared to
    pay on an ascending scale for his extra pets. In our fight with
    Germany we must neglect no precaution however small. To get the
    KAISER back to his kennel we will, if necessary, empty our own.
    Doggedness is essential to victory, but not over-doggedness.
    Then let us, in CALVERLEY'S phrase, "curtail the already
    cur-tailed cur."</p>

    <h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>

    <p>IN the long long-ago, Frobisher and I, assisted by a handful
    of native troopers, kept the flag flying at M'Vini.</p>

    <p>We hoisted it to the top of a tree at sun-up, where it
    remained, languidly flapping its tatters over leagues of
    Central African bush till sun-set, when we hauled it down
    again&mdash;an arduous life. After we had been at M'Vini about
    six months, had shot everything worth shooting, and knew one
    another's funny stories off by heart, Frobisher and I grew
    bored with each other, hated in fact the sight, sound and mere
    propinquity of each other, and, shutting ourselves up in our
    separate huts, communicated only on occasions of the direct
    necessity, and then by the curtest of official notes. Thus a
    further three months dragged on.</p>

    <p>Then one red-hot afternoon came Frobisher's boy to my
    wattle-and-dab, bearing a note.</p>

    <p>"Visitor approaching from S.W. got up like a May-Queen;
    think it must be the KAISER. Lend me a bottle of whisky and
    mount guard&mdash;must impress the blighter."</p>

    <p>I attached my last bottle of Scotch to the messenger and
    sallied forth to mount a guard, none too easy a job, as the
    Army had gone to celebrate somebody's birthday in the
    neighbouring village. However, I discovered one remaining
    trooper lying in the shade of a loquat-tree. He was
    sick&mdash;dying, he assured me; but I persuaded him to
    postpone his demise for at least half-an-hour, requisitioned
    his physician (the local witch doctor) and two camp followers,
    and, leaving my cook-boy to valet them, dashed to my hut to
    make my own toilet. A glimpse through the cane mats five
    minutes later showed me that our visitors had arrived.</p>

    <p>A fruity German officer in full gala rig (white gloves and
    all) was cruising about on mule-back before our camp, trying to
    discover whether it was inhabited or not. We let him cruise for
    a quarter of an hour without taking any steps to enlighten him.
    Then, at a given signal, Frobisher, caparisoned in every
    fal-lal he could collect, issued from his hut, and I turned out
    the improvised guard. A stirring spectacle; and it had the
    desired effect, for the German afterwards admitted to being
    deeply impressed, especially by the local wizard, who paraded
    in his professional regalia, and, coming to cross-purposes with
    his rifle, bayoneted himself and wept bitterly. The ceremonies
    over and the casualty removed we adjourned to Frobisher's
    <i>kya</i>, broached the whisky and sat about in solemn state,
    stiff with accoutrements, sodden with perspiration. Our visitor
    kept the Red, White and Black flying on a tree over the border,
    he explained; this was his annual ceremonial call. He sighed
    and brushed the sweat from his nose with the tips of a white
    glove&mdash;"the weather was warm, <i>nicht wahr?</i>" I
    admitted that we dabbled in flag-flying ourselves and that the
    weather was all he claimed for it (which effort cost me about
    four pounds in weight). Tongues lolling, flanks heaving, we
    discussed the hut-tax, the melon crop, the monkey-nut market,
    the nigger&mdash;and the weather again.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Frobisher sprang up, cast loose the shackles of his
    Sam Browne, hurled it into a corner, and began tearing at his
    tunic hooks. I stared at him in amazement&mdash;such manners
    before visitors. But our immaculate guest leapt to his feet
    with a roar like a freed lion, and, stripping his white gloves,
    flung them after the Sam Browne, whereupon a fury of undressing
    came upon us. Helmets, belts, tunics, shirts were piled into
    the corner, until at length we stood in our underclothes,
    laughing and unashamed. After that we got on famously, that
    Teuton and we, and three days later, when he swarmed aboard his
    mule and left home (in pyjamas this time) it was with real
    regret we waved him farewell.</p>

    <p>But not for long. Within a month we were surprised by a hail
    from the bush, and there was Otto, mule, pyjamas and all.</p>

    <p>"Ullo, 'ullo, 'ullo!" he carolled. 'Ere gomes ze Sherman
    invasion! Durn out ze guard!" He roared with laughter, fell off
    his palfrey and bawled for his batman, who ambled up balancing
    a square box on his woolly pate.</p>

    <p>His mother in Munich had sent him a case of Lion Brew, Otto
    explained, so he had brought it along.</p>

    <p>We wassailed deep into that night and out the other side,
    and we liked our Otto more than ever. We had plenty in common,
    the same loneliness, fevers, climate, and niggers to wrestle
    with; moreover he had been in England, and liked it; he smoked
    a pipe; he washed. Also, as he privily confided to us in the
    young hours of one morning, he had his doubts as to the
    divinity of the KAISER, and was not quite convinced that
    RICHARD STRAUSS had composed the music of the spheres.</p>

    <p>He was a bad Hun (which probably accounted for his presence
    at the uttermost, hottermost edge of the ALL-HIGHEST'S
    dominions), but a good fellow. Anyhow, we liked him, Frobisher
    and I; liked his bull-mouthed laughter, his drinking songs and
    full-blooded anecdotes, and, on the occasions of his frequent
    visits, put our boredom from us, pretended to be on the most
    affectionate terms, and even laughed uproariously at each
    other's funny stories. Up at M'Vini, in the long long-ago, the
    gleam of pyjamas amongst the loquats, and "'Ere gomes ze
    Sherman invasion!" booming through the bush, became a signal
    for general good-will.</p>

    <p>In the fulness of time Otto went home on leave, and, shortly
    afterwards, the world blew up.</p>

    <p>And now I have met him again, a sodden, muddy, bloody,
    shrunken, saddened Otto, limping through a snowstorm in the
    custody of a Canadian Corporal. He was the survivor of a
    rear-guard, the Canuck explained, and had "scrapped like a bag
    of wild-cats" until knocked out by a rifle butt. As for Otto
    himself, he hadn't much to say; he looked old, cold, sick and
    infinitely disgusted. He had always been a poor Hun.</p>

    <p>Only once did he show a gleam of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"
       id="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span> his ancient form of those

            <p>Second-Lieutenant Humphrey Spence</p>

            <p>Had no idea of precedence;</p>

            <p>Than any other messroom bore;</p>

            <p>And he would try to make a pal</p>

            <p>But even a horrified non-com</p>

            <p>Although in other ways quite nice,</p>

            <p>He was perverted by this vice.</p>

            <p>For instance, once he had to tea</p>

            <p>A private in the A.S.C.,</p>

            <p>And asked to meet him Cathcart-Crewe,</p>

            <p>A Major in the Horse Guards Blue.</p>

            <p>Too frequently did it occur</p>

            <p>That, when a senior officer</p>

            <p>Was with him, he would up and take</p>

            <p>Salutes from privates. Why, he'd shake</p>

            <p>Even Sir DOUGLAS by the hand</p>

            <p>His water-glass (when wine was scanty),</p>

            <p>And shouted, "Cheero, Adjutanty!"</p>

    <h2>SCHOOL.</h2>

    <p>During the past week there has taken place, almost without
    our knowledge, a great migration of boys. From their homes, out
    on to the roads and railways, has been pouring a flood of big
    boys, middle-sized boys, small boys, old boys, new boys, all
    tending towards the various schools where they are supposed to
    make all the best parts of human knowledge their own and to
    live a life of dignified abstraction from the troubles of the
    world, in the midst of their own <i>argot</i> and their own
    special traditions.</p>

    <p>Of the big boys and the middle-sized boys I have little to
    say. They are already imbued, if one may say so, with the
    influence of their school, and can hold their own with the
    masters and their fellow-boys. Much as they enjoy their
    holidays, they show no undue reluctance to take up again the
    burden of their studies at a place which they will afterwards
    consider as having given them some of the happiest days of
    their lives. Many of them indeed are already or are in process
    of becoming the trusted coadjutors of the headmaster and his
    colleagues in the work of maintaining good order and discipline
    in the school. They are monitors&mdash;tremendous
    word!&mdash;or prefects or pr&aelig;postors, and their <i>mitis
    sapientia</i>, no less than their muscular strength, causes
    them to be feared and venerated.</p>

    <p>Of such awful beings one must not speak lightly lest some
    terrific fate reserved for scoffers overtake one. No, my
    concern at present is rather with the little boys who have gone
    up for the first time to their preparatory school, those
    forlorn scraps of humanity who are beginning a life entirely
    new to them in all its details. Hitherto, except for visits to
    the seaside with their parents and family, they have not spent
    a night away from home. Now they are separated from their
    parents and plunged into a world of perfect strangers.
    Everything is done to make them at ease and comfortable in
    their new surroundings; the headmaster is kindness itself, the
    matron beams on them with smiles and fortifies them with
    encouragement; but just at first the wrench for the little
    fellows is great. In a day or two, however, they will begin to
    acclimatise themselves; the strangeness will begin to wear off;
    and having borne up bravely against their first sense of
    loneliness in the midst of a crowd they will gradually become
    parts of the machine to the making of which many gentle and
    sympathising hands for years past have contributed.</p>

    <p>"Schools are not what they were," says one of my friends.
    "There is no bullying nowadays and little roughness of any
    kind. Masters are not looked upon as the natural enemies of
    boys. Corporal punishment, except for the gravest offences, is
    abolished. Whereas, formerly, little boys were at once sucked
    into the vortex of a Public School, there are now Preparatory
    Schools, where Tommie and Dickie and Harry, aged from nine to
    ten, learn the business of Public Schooling in a manner suited
    to their age and capacity. When we were boys," he continues,
    "these admirable buffer states were so few that they might
    almost be said not to exist at all; they now flourish
    everywhere. The path of the little boy is thus made easier for
    him."</p>

    <p>"But," I said, "is a little boy, then, never brought to a
    sense of his unimportance by being physically, if not morally,
    kicked? Is he to pass his life in a condition of Sybaritic
    softness?"</p>

    <p>"You need not," he said, "worry about that. Softness makes
    no appeal to the average English boy."</p>

    <p>When therefore, on a day in last week, it happened to me to
    take a little boy I happen to know to his Preparatory School on
    his first day of his first term there, I did so with no undue
    depression. "Be a good boy," I said to him; "never tell a lie,
    never push yourself forward, and don't swank about yourself."
    It was good advice so far as it went, but it did not make any
    great impression on him, for he only answered, "Of course," or
    "Of course I shan't," to every item that I put before him. I
    wonder how many fathers have recently inculcated these and
    similar high-toned principles on their little boys, only to
    meet with the same uninterested acquiescence. And even our
    parting was not so dejected as it might have been, for by that
    time another new boy had come upon the scene, and he and mine
    had been irresistibly drawn to one another, and were chatting
    gaily when it was time for me to go.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p class="ctr">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks.</i>)</p>

    <p>I was some way into <i>Thorgills of Treadholt</i> (WARD,
    LOCK), thinking what an unusually plausible and imaginative
    yarn it was, when I turned back for possible enlightenment, and
    found a note to the effect that it was a transcription of an
    Icelandic saga. Those old fellows knew their business. I am not
    sagacious enough to guess where Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT has passed
    beyond transcription to creation, but I can tell you that he
    offers his readers a very charming and finished piece of work.
    Boys of all ages should delight in this record of the fights
    and wanderings and stout diplomacy of the chieftain
    <i>Thorgills</i>, who was destined from his cradle to be a
    notable leader of men. His marriage with <i>Thorey</i> was a
    romance of as exquisite a flavour as any that our sophisticated
    age can show, and its tragic end wrings the heart with its
    infinite pathos. By some singular discretion Mr. HEWLETT has
    chosen to eschew the least approach to Wardour-Street idiom,
    and this gives the narrative a simplicity, a sanity and a vivid
    sense of reality which are extraordinarily more effective than
    the goodliest tushery, of which flamboyant art Mr. HEWLETT is
    no mean master. I am sure he has chosen this time a more
    excellent way. There are transcriptions and transcriptions.
    This is brilliantly done.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I cannot help regretting that Miss RHODA BROUGHTON has not
    thought fit to publish her total fictional tonnage (if without
    disrespect I may employ a metaphor of the moment) on the
    title-page of her latest volume. Certainly the tale of her
    output must by this time reach impressive dimensions. And the
    wonder is that <i>A Thorn in the Flesh</i> (STANLEY PAUL)
    betrays absolutely no evidence of staleness. If the outlook
    here is a thought less romantic than in certain novels that
    drew sighs from my adolescent breast, this is a change inherent
    in the theme. For the matter of the present work is a study in
    conjugal tedium. <i>Parthenope</i> (name of ill-omen) was one
    of those unhappy and devastating beings who go through life
    fated to bore their nearest and dearest to the verge of lunacy.
    So that her marriage to poor well-meaning <i>Willy Steele</i>
    had not endured for more than a matter of weeks before the
    wretched man fled from his newly-made nest, with the heart-cry
    (uttered to <i>Parthenope's</i> female relatives, themselves
    too sympathetic to resent it), "I cannot stand her any longer!"
    This unfortunate <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> is very
    ingeniously contrasted with the courtship of another couple,
    immune from the curse; and the whole story is as fresh as it is
    amusing. Perhaps it might have been told in fewer words; at
    times the slender theme seems a trifle overladen. But probably
    your true Broughtonians (who must be reckoned in thousands)
    would condemn such a suggestion as heresy; and, if they be
    satisfied, as they certainly will be, then all is well.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is a tribute at once to the art of her treatment and the
    actuality of her theme that, after reading the delicate little
    study of modern romance that ELIZABETH ROBINS PENNELL
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"
       id="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span> calls <i>The Lovers</i>
       (HEINEMANN), I cannot determine whether the clever writer
       was reproducing or inventing&mdash;she begins so
       convincingly with the statement that it was her first
       chapter, itself an article in <i>The Century</i>, describing
       the life of The Lovers as she watched it from her window,
       that brought about her friendship with the originals, and
       thus her knowledge of their further history. Anyhow, true or
       not, it is the kind of story that has been going on all
       round us in these days of love and heroism. Mrs. PENNELL
       first began to watch her pair of <i>amoureux</i> in their
       attic, which was overlooked from her higher window (most
       readers could probably make a shrewd guess at its postal
       district) in those seemingly so distant years when the young
       champions of artistic London used to meet at a certain
       <i>caf&eacute;</i>, wonderfully clad, to consume vast
       quantities of milk. Then came the War; the boy-husband
       enlisted, went to the Front&mdash;and the end is as we all
       have known it many and many times. In this little book the
       too familiar story is given with a restraint and absence of
       striving after effect that leave me, as I say, uncertain
       whether its appeal is due to art or actuality. But in either
       case Mrs. PENNELL has told it very well.</p>

    <p>"Father, what is the difference between Tories and
    Radicals?" "Radicals, my dear, are the infamous crew who wish
    to destroy all the noble institutions for which the Tories
    would give their life-blood." "And which are you, Father?" I
    have inflicted this ancient (and, I always think, rather
    touching) scrap of dialogue upon you because it exactly
    illustrates my impression of <i>The Soul of Ulster</i> (HURST
    AND BLACKETT). In other words, this little book, written as
    ably and attractively as you would expect from the author of
    <i>The First Seven Divisions</i>, is really less a
    dispassionate survey of the Home Rule difficulty than a piece
    of special pleading for the Northern cause. According,
    therefore, to your own attitude towards this problem will
    characters occupies her rural stage&mdash;an old grandmother,
    be your estimate of Lord ERNEST HAMILTON'S arguments. To the
    bigoted (or confirmed) Orangeman they will seem revelation; to
    the confirmed (or bigoted) Nationalist they will as clearly
    seem rubbish. Even I, who admit the justice of the author's
    contentions, fancied now and again (as in the matter of the
    "Peep-o'-Day Boys," for example) that a slightly more generous
    admission of faults on his own side would have strengthened the
    presentation of his case. One of the most interesting chapters
    of a quite short volume is that in which the author explains
    his belief, at first rather startling, that the eventual
    solution of the vexed question may be provided through the Sinn
    Fein movement. That hope, and the reasons for it, are certainly
    alone worth the half-crown for which you can examine them.</p>

    <p>SERGE AKSAKOFF, a distinguished Russian writer of the first
    half of the nineteenth century, gave the world a portrait of
    his grandfather. It is now translated with a singular felicity
    by Mr. J.D. DUFF, under the title, <i>A Russian Gentleman</i>
    (ARNOLD), and I should like to say that I, who have suffered
    something from translations out of the Russian, have very
    rarely read one which ran with such plausible smoothness and
    gave so clear an impression of a charming original. STEFAN
    MIHAILOVITCH BAGROFF was reckoned a good sort and a just if
    rather uncompromising man. His character is drawn with faithful
    exactness and praised with simple filial appreciation. The
    foibles of this worthy patriarch, such as the dragging of his
    wife along the floor when he was excessively annoyed, so that
    she went with her head bound for a year thereafter, are excused
    on the ground of his general decency. And indeed he was a
    lovable old boy, and the simple and unselfconscious artistry
    with which the author develops his character, and that of his
    daughter-in-law, SOFYA NIKOLAYEVNA, delights the jaded literary
    palate. AKSAKOFF has a quite singular power of selecting just
    the incident, the phrase, the gesture, the feature of the
    landscape which make you exclaim with a start, "Why, I'm seeing
    and hearing all this!" It is such a book as an historian of the
    modern school would delight in, more engrossing than fiction of
    the most realistic type. There is incident in it too&mdash;as
    of the degenerate KUROLYESSOFF, a cousin-in-law of
    MIHAILOVITCH, who used to flog his serfs, sometimes to death,
    for the pleasure of seeing them suffer; while the opening
    pages, describing the trekking of the family out of far-eastern
    Orenburg into the adjoining province of Ufa, and the building
    of the mill and the dam, are astonishingly vivid and
    agreeable.</p>

    <p><i>A Maid o' Dorset</i> (CASSELL) can be recommended to
    anyone in need of light refreshment after a course of sterner
    literature. Here we are back again in the world of small
    things; but if "M.E. FRANCIS'S" theme is trivial there is no
    denying the art with which she handles it. Just a quartette of
    characters occupies her rural stage&mdash;an old grandmother,
    wise with the wisdom of years, her granddaughter, a middle-aged
    farmer and a young gipsy "dairy-chap." To the horror of her
    relations the Maid o' Dorset conceives an infatuation for the
    gipsy, a clever rogue but no match for the grandmother. I have
    met a good many farmers in my time, but never one so
    simple-minded as <i>Solomon Blanchard</i>. It is all very
    Franciscan, and seems easy enough, but if you think, for that
    reason, that you could do it yourself, you couldn't. Its charm
    lies in its fragrance, and that is a quality which is not
    lightly come by.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
